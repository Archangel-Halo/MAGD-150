# MAGD-150 (GH-Pages)
### A side branch where I've uploaded previous assignment projects.

#### [Lab Assignment 3](EmmerichHLabAssignment3,js.zip)
##### A project where axis lines follow the point where your cursor is and displays both the current FPS of the program and the specific X and Y coordinates of your cursor.

#### [Lab Assignment 5](EmmerichHLabAssignment5.js.zip)
##### A project where a 3D cube sits in the center of the canvas. The cube can be rotated both horizontally and vertically by pressing the arrow keys, and based on the current positioning of the cube smaller versions appear randomly around it with the same position. The rate of the smaller cubes is currently tied directly with the Frame Rate of the program.

#### [Lab Assignment 8](EmmerichH_LabAssignment8.js.zip)
##### A project that when launched (using a Web Server) displays both two images I added (one for background and one for foreground), along with two sets of bubble text that I modified to shift colors and float up and down in place.
